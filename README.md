# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
This project used OpenWeatherMap and GoogleMaps APIs to collect, explore, and visualize weather and travel data. This data was then used to create a travel app that suggests cities to travel to and hotels to stay in. The suggestions are based on user input of the maximum and minimum temperatures they would want in their destinations. The project also has the ability to automatically generate directions between 4 cities, with the stipulation that there is a driveable route between the cities.

### Resources
